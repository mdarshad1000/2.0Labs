It kept happening.

I'd be deep in a technical session with Claude, mapping out my app's architecture, when it would drop a brilliant - but complex idea which I had never considered.

I needed to explore it, but I was trapped. Either I
Open a new chat, and I'd lose context.
Or stay there, and I'd drown the thread in schemas and noise.


That's the flaw in a typical chat, you don't think linearly,
but in chains of thoughts

So I built one that works that way, and prevents context dilution.

Each side-quest becomes a node connected with your chain of thought.
